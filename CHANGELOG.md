## 0.29.1
* Fix handling of 200 responses with `parse_http` as well as handling of very small responses which do not need range access

## 0.28.0
* Change `FormatParser.parse_http` to follow HTTP redirects

## 0.27.0

* Hotfix Moov parser

## 0.25.1
* MOV: Fix error "negative length"
* MOV: Fix reading dimensions in multi-track files
* MP3: Fix parse of the Xing header to not raise errors

## 0.25.0
* MP3: add suport to id3 v2.4.x
* JPEG: Update gem exifr to 1.3.8 to fix a bug

## 0.24.2
* Update gem id3tag to 0.14.0 to fix MP3 issues

## 0.24.1
* Fix MP3 frames reading to jump correctly to the next bytes

## 0.24.0
* The TIFF parser will now return :arw as format for Sony ARW files insted of :tif so that the caller can decide whether it
  wants to deal with RAW processing or not

## 0.23.1
* Updated gem exifr to fix problems related to jpeg files from Olympos microscopes, which often have bad thumbnail data

## 0.23.0

  `config.active_storage.analyzers.prepend FormatParser::ActiveStorage::BlobAnalyzer`
* Ignore empty ID3 tags and do not allow them to overwrite others
* Update the id3tag dependency so that we can fallback to UTF8 instead of raising an error when parsing
  MP3 files

## 0.22.1
* Fix Zip parser to not raise error for invalid zip files, with an invalid central directory

## 0.22.0
* Adds option `stringify_keys: true` to #as_json methods (fix #151)

* MPEG: Ensure parsing does not inadvertently return an Integer instead of Result|nil
* MPEG: Scan further into the MPEG file than previously (scan 32 1KB chunks)
* MPEG: Ensure the parser does not raise an exception when there is no data to read for scanning beyound the initial header

## 0.21.0

## 0.20.1
* Make sure EXIF results work correctly with ActiveSupport JSON encoders

## 0.20.0

## 0.19.0
* Improve handling of Sony ARW files (make sure the width/height is correctly recognized)
* Update Travis matrix and gitignore

## 0.18.0
* Mark m4v as one of the filename extensions likely to parse via the MOOV parser
* Adopt [Hippocratic license v. 1.2](https://firstdonoharm.dev/version/1/2/license.html)
  Note that this might make the license conditions unacceptable for your project. If that is the case,
  you can use the 0.17.X branch of the library which stays under the original, exact MIT license.

## 0.17.0
* Remove parser factories. A parser should respond to `likely_match?` and `call`. If a parser has to be instantiated anew for
  every call the parser should take care of instantiating itself.
* Add support for BMP files with core headers (older version of the BMP format)

## 0.16.2
* All EXIF: Deal with EXIF orientations that get parsed as an array of [Orientation, nil] due to incorrect padding

## 0.16.1
* All EXIF: Make sure the 0 orientation does not get silently treated as orientation 8, mislabling
  images which are not rotated as being rotated (orientation changed)
* All EXIF: Make sure the 0 orientation (`unknown`) is correctly passed and represented
* JPEG: Make sure multiple EXIF tags in APP1 markers get handled correctly (via overlays)

## 0.16.0
* Add `filename_hint` keyword argument to `FormatParser.parse`. This can hint the library to apply
  the parser that will likely match for this filename first, and the other parsers later. This helps
  avoiding extra work when parsing less-popular file formats, and can be optionally used if the caller
  knows the filename of the original file. Note that the filename is only that: a **hint,** it helps
  apply parsers more efficiently but does not specify the actual format of the file that is going to
  be detected.

## 0.15.1
* Relax the "ks" dependency version since we do not need the constraint to be so strict

## 0.15.0
* Allow setting `:priority` when registering a parser, to make sure certain parsers are applied earlier - depending
  on detection confidence and file format popularity at WT.

## 0.14.1
* Care caching: Clear pages more deliberately instead of relegating them to GC
* JPEG: Clear the EXIF buffer explicitly

## 0.14.0
* PDF: Reduce the PDF parser to the basic binary detection (PDF/not PDF) until we have a better/more robust PDF parser
* MP3: Fix the byte length of MPEG frames calculation to correctly account for ID3V1 and ID3V2 instead of ID3V1 twice
* MP3: Remove the workaround for `id3tag` choking on non-matching genre strings (bumps dependency on `id3tag`)
* Use Measurometer provided by the [measurometer gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/measurometer)
* Ogg: Add support for the Ogg format

## 0.13.6
* Make all reads in the MOOV decoder strict - fail early if reads are improperly sized
* Disable parsing for `udta` atoms in MP4/MOV since we do not have a good way of parsing them yet

## 0.13.5
* Use the same TIFF parsing flow for CR2 files as it seems we are not very reliable _yet._ The CR2 parser will need some work.

## 0.13.4
* Make sure JSON data never contains NaN, fix the test that was supposed to verify that but didn't
* Forcibly UTF-8 sanitize all EXIF data when building JSON

## 0.13.3
* Add a fixture to make sure all parsers can cope with an empty file when using `parse_http`
* Terminate the ZIP parser early with empty input
* Terminate the MP3 parser early with empty or too small input

## 0.13.2
* Handle BMP files with pixel array offsets larger than 54

## 0.13.1
* Avoid ZIP checks in the JPEG parser which are no longer necessary

## 0.13.0
* Replace the homegrown ID3 parser with [id3tag](https://github.com/krists/id3tag) - this introduces id3tag
  as a dependency in addition to `exifr`, but the gains are substantial.

## 0.12.4
* Ensure JPEG recognition only runs when the JPEG SOI marker is detected **at the start** of file. Previously
  the JPEG parser would scan for the marker, sometimes finding it (appropriately) in places like... MP3 album
  artwork inside ID3 tags. Or Keynote documents. Or whatnot - lots of things have JPEG thumbnails embedded.

## 0.12.3
* Make sure all strings going to the JSON representations of parse results are encoded as UTF-8 or escaped

## 0.12.2
* Make sure the `VERSION` constant is available in the loaded gem. Previously the constant would be made
  available by Bundler when developing the library - since it loads the `.gemspec` which, in turn, requires the
  version.rb file, but when used as a gem the version.rb file would not end up being loaded.

## 0.12.1
* Reinstate support for Ruby 2.2.0
* Fix support for JRuby 9.0

## 0.12.0
* Relay upstream status from `RemoteIO` in the `status_code` attribute (returns an `Integer`)

## 0.11.0
* Add `Image#display_width_px` and `Image#display_height_px` for EXIF/aspect corrected display dimensions, and provide
  those values from a few parsers already. Also make full EXIF data available for JPEG/TIFF in `intrinsics[:exif]`
* Adds `limits_config` option to `FormatParser.parse()` for tweaking buffers and read limits externally

## 0.10.0
* Adds the `format_parser_inspect` binary for parsing a file from the commandline
  and returning results in JSON
* Adds the `FormatParser.parse_at(path)` convenience method

## 0.9.4
* Fix a TIFF parsing regression introduced in 0.3.1 that led to all TIFFs being incorrectly parsed

## 0.9.3
* Fix a JPEG parsing regression introduced in 0.9.1

## 0.9.2 (yanked)
* Make sure MP3 parser returns `nil` when encountering infinite duration
* Do not read JPEG APP1 markers that contain no EXIF data
* Explicitly replace `Float::INFINITY` values in `AttributesJSON` with `nil` as per JSON convention
* Make sure the cached pages in `Care` are explicitly deleted after each `parse` call (should help GC)
* Raise the pagefaults restriction to 16 to cope with "too many useless markers in JPEGs" scenario once more

## 0.9.1 (yanked)
* Perf: Make JPEG parser bail out earlier if no marker is found while scanning through 1024 bytes of data

## 0.9.0
* Add a parser for the BMP image file format

## 0.8.0
* Add `Measurometer` for applying instrumentation around FormatParser operaions. See documentation for usage.
