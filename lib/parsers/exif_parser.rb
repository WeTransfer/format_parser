  # With some formats, multiple EXIF tag frames can be included in a single file.
  # For example, JPEGs might have multiple APP1 markers which each contain EXIF
  # data. The EXIF data in them, however, is not necessarily "complete" - it seems
  # most applications assume that these blocks "overwrite" each other with the properties
  # they specify. Probably this is done for more efficient saving - instead of overwriting
  # the EXIF data with a modified version - which would also potentially disturb any digital
  # signing that this data might include - the applications are supposed to follow the order
  # in which these tags appear in the file:
  #
  # Take a resized image for example:
  #
  #   APP1 {author: 'John', pixel_width: 1024}
  #   APP1 {pixel_width: 10}
  #
  # That image would get a combined EXIF of:
  #
  #   APP1 {author: 'John', pixel_width: 10}
  #
  # since the frame that comes later in the file overwrites a property. From what I see
  # exiftools do this is the way it works.
  #
  # This class acts as a wrapper for this "layering" of chunks of EXIF properties, and will
  # follow the following conventions:
  #
  # * When merging data for JSON conversion, it will merge it top-down. It will overwrite
  #   any specified properties. An exception is made for orientation (see below)
  # * When retrieving a property, it will look "from the end to the beginning" of the EXIF
  #   dataframe stack, looking for the first dataframe which has this property with a non-nil value
  # * When retrieving orientation, it will pick the first orientation value which is not nil
  #   but also not 0 ("unknown orientation"). Even files in our test suite contain these.
